But having seen medium and high categories occupy almost 60% of the the values, what we do is we fill the null values with a special category called medium to high and replace this medium to high with all null variables so that we have now four categories which is low, high, medium and medium to high. so instead of imputing 4153 variables what we dis is we replaced it with a new subcategory that will be advantageous for us in the analysis**"

Instead of imputing the null values we are actually replacing the null values with the most found subcategory so that in this way we are not losing valuable information that rows have given to us as well as we are quite practical in identifying the real value that could be possible in replacing these null value.
